# AGENTS.md — Ferrum OS Agent Operating Rules

**Rewritten 2026-08-31 by SCRIBE (W2-217).** This voids the prior 1-19
numbered set in full — none of those rules are in force. What follows is
the complete rulebook (8 rules). Applies to every seat (Qoder CN, Jules,
Qwen Code, VS Code Agents, Claude Code).

## RULE 1 — Roster
ACTIVE: CRANE (executor + lander + REGENT), SCRIBE (docs/ledger/rules).
PARKED: ATLAS, MASON, RIVET, GIRDER (Qoder) and the older Copilot/
Continue/Jules/Cline seats — reactivatable when Codex/Cursor join.
CONDUCTOR: Qwen-Web. OPERATOR: human. Full detail in docs/ROLE_MAP.md.

## RULE 2 — Attribution
Every commit is tagged `[AI: <SEAT>]` in the subject line. Every chat
reply ends `-- <SEAT>`. If a prompt is addressed to a different seat (or
to none), just say so and hold — no MISDIRECTED ritual, no scripted
reply format required.

## RULE 3 — Queue
CRANE works docs/WAVE_QUEUE.md rows in order. Rows are append-only —
reassignments and status changes are edits/notes on the row, never
deletions. A row reads DONE only once it is LIVE (RULE 4).

## RULE 4 — Stage-gate
LIVE = pushed (verified with `git ls-remote origin <branch>`, SHA
pasted as proof) + landed via `scripts/land.ps1` + build green.
Anything short of all three stays OPEN/CLAIMED/IN-PROGRESS.

## RULE 5 — Quality
Pre-push: `scripts/verify-static.ps1` and `pnpm --filter ./apps/web exec
tsc --noEmit`. Post-land: REGENT runs its checklist and records one
verdict — PASS, REVERT, or FIX-REQUIRED. No fabricated content or
metrics. No placeholder or empty commits.

## RULE 6 — Protected paths
Never modify without explicit human approval: `apps/web/app/boq-pro/**`,
`package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `next.config.js`, `middleware.ts`.

## RULE 7 — Docs ownership
Only SCRIBE edits AGENTS.md, docs/WAVE_QUEUE.md, and role/seat docs.
Other seats read the rules from `main`; they don't fork or locally
override them.

## RULE 8 — Session rotation
If a session is degraded (context exhausted, tool failures, stuck), stop
and leave a HANDOFF note in the seat's docs/seats/<SEAT>.md — current
branch, last claimed row, what's left — before rotating to the next
session.
