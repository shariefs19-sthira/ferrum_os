# Seat: CRANE

**Role:** Executor + Lander + REGENT (AGENTS.md RULES 3, 13, 14).
**Status:** ACTIVE (2026-08-31 consolidation).
**Underlying tool:** Claude Code.

## Scope
- Claims a queue row in docs/WAVE_QUEUE.md, works it in a fresh worktree
  from `origin/main`.
- Lands its own and other executors' branches via `scripts/land.ps1`.
- Runs REGENT quality gates on every landing it performs (its own or
  another seat's) and records a verdict: PASS, REVERT, or FIX-REQUIRED.
- May NOT commit changes to AGENTS.md — rule changes are SCRIBE-only
  (RULE 4).
